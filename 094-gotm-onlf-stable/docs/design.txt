- timecodes are transmitted as the lower order 32 bits of the
  nanoTime() they encode. a 64-bit value is reconstructed by adding
  the difference between the current and previous timecodes to a
  timecode accumulator. thus at least one packet must be transmitted
  every 4 seconds to avoid overflow. this requirement is easily met by
  a source. to ensure that the splitter receive timecodes can always
  be reconstructed, an unblockable "wassup" packet is introduced every
  second.
